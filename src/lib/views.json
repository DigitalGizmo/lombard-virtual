    "text": "The Lombard Auto Tractor-Truck was designed by Alvin Orlando Lombard and produced in Waterville, Maine from 1914 to 1936. Powerful, fast (for a tractor) and easy to operate they were an important part of Maine forest industry. Use the slider to rotate the Lombard Auto Tractor-Truck and explore further!",

      "para1": "By early 1914, the Lombard Traction Engine Company of Waterville, Maine was producing a successful line of steam-powered log haulers and gasoline-powered “lag bed” tractors. In April 1914 Alvin Orlando Lombard filed a patent for a “Tractor Truck”. By 1917 Lombard ceased production of steam-powered log haulers and would focus on the production of Lombard Auto Tractor-Trucks until the close of production in 1934.",
      "para2": "The 10 ton, Lombard Auto Tractor-Truck in the Maine State Museum collection (Serial Number 3031) was purchased new by Edouard Lacroix’s on December 6th 1925 and delivered to Township 5, Range 20 for use on Lacroix’s Hurricane Pond logging operation. By 1927 the tractor was in use by Lacroix’s Madawaska Company hauling long sled trains of pulpwood from 3rd Musquacook Lake to Churchill Lake where it was abandoned at the close of the operation in 1938.",
      "cap1": "Between 1914 and the end of production in 1934, Lombard’s Waterville, Maine factory produced an estimated 340 gasoline-powered tractors of all types.",

    "title": "Crawler Tracks",
    "text": "In 1900, Alvin Lombard developed and patented the first practical crawler track system. The unique “Lag Bed” used on the Lombard Auto Tractor-Truck was developed in 1914. The Lag Bed allowed the Lombard Auto Tractor-Truck to operate in snow, on ice and mud. Use the slider to rotate the Lag bad and explore further!",

      "para1": "Alvin Orlando Lombard held patents for a number of crawler track or “lag bed” designs. The patent for the system used on the Lombard Tractor-Truck was granted on July 24th, 1917. The advantage of a track system is that the tracks spread the weight of the machine over a much larger area than a round wheel can. Though the weight of the tractor is approximately 10 tons the ground pressure exerted by the tracks is only 6.75 pounds per square inch. This allows it to operate over soft ground, ice and snow without getting stuck. Aggressive grousers (the raised bars across the track) provide tremendous traction.",
      "para2": "Each lag bed assembly features two roller chains to transmit the weight of the machine (13,850 pounds) to the trackpads. The roller chains act as rollers allowing the “track shoe” to smoothly pass over the track pads. To increase traction the track shoe is curved. This serves to concentrate maximum weight at one specific point thus increasing traction. The entire “lag bed” assembly pivots vertically on a shaft allowing the tracks to adjust to rough terrain. The tracks require no lubrication and have an average life expectancy of approximately 8,000 miles.",
      "cap1": "Each track or “lag bed” measures 12 inches wide and contains 30 manganese steel track pads fastened together with 60 lag pins.",
      "cap2": "This shows the component parts of the complex lag bed invention."

    "title": "Steering Skis",
    "text": "How was it steered? The Lombard Auto Tractor-Truck was used on ice and snow. Wheels would sink into the snow and slide on ice. To solve this the Lombard Auto Tractor-Truck used a “steering sled”. The steering sled could be swapped for wheels for use in the non-winter months. Use the slider to rotate the steering sled and explore further!",
    "more": {
      "para1": "The Lombard Tractor-Truck was designed to pull heavy sled-trains loaded with logs or pulpwood over ice and snow roads. The “steering sled” made up of wood skis and castings is very similar to the skis found on a typical logging sled of the era.",
      "para2": "When the driver turns the steering wheel a pinion gear turns a bevel gear attached to the steering drum shaft. As the steering drum shaft rotates one steering chain is tightened while the other is loosened causing the steering quadrant to pivot the skis in the direction the driver desires to go. The “steering sled” could be replaced by wheels if needed.",

All of these were important to the success of the Lombard Auto Tractor-Truck. Use the slider to explore further!",
    "more": {
      "para1": "Though Lombard purchased engines from a variety of manufactures and briefly manufactured his own engines to power the 10-ton Lombard Tractor-Trucks, the most common were the six-cylinder, model PT engines produced by the Wisconsin Motor Manufacturing Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. With a displacement of 1,090 cubic inches (18 liters), the engine produced 104 horsepower and over 500 foot-pounds of torque at 1,200 revolutions per minute. Fuel consumption was approximately 8 gallons per hour. The engine features electric start, magneto ignition and a manganese bronze crankcase.",

    "more": {
      "para1": "Lombard’s goal was to develop a vehicle that combined the power and strength of a tractor with the ease of operation of a truck of the period. Top speed of a Lombard Tractor-Truck was 7 to 9 miles per hour. However, when coasting down a hill, a speed of 20 miles per hour or more could be reached. Having a powerful and reliable braking system was essential.",
      "para2": "The Lombard Tractor-Truck features a “positive acting” hand and foot-operated brake. The brake is positioned at the rear of the tractor and works on the drive shaft. When the driver presses the brake pedal or moves the hand brake lever forward a system of rods, and bell cranks press two cast iron shoes firmly against the brake drum. Lombard advertised that this brake system would hold back any load on any hill encountered during normal use.",
